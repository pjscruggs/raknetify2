/**
 * Declares which vanilla traffic group must remain ordered with a mod's custom payloads. The
 * available groups are {@code ui} for world-independent menus and interactions, {@code entity} for
 * entity spawn, removal, and movement, {@code world_interaction} for inventories and other
 * world-dependent interactions, {@code effects} for sound and particles, and {@code chunk} for
 * terrain, block, and lighting updates. All groups retain reliable ordered delivery.
 *
 * <p>Fabric mods can implement the following provider using only JDK types and list its class under
 * the {@code raknetify:packet_channels} key in their {@code fabric.mod.json} entrypoints:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public final class OrderingProvider implements Consumer<BiConsumer<String, String>> {
 *     public void accept(BiConsumer<String, String> register) {
 *         register.accept("example:entity_path", "entity");
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Fabric does not invoke this entrypoint when Raknetify2 is absent. Providers should only
 * declare identifiers and groups, without depending on another mod's initialization having
 * finished. Plugins can call {@link #register(String, String)} during their own initialization
 * instead.
 *
 * <p>Each new RakNet connection advertises its declarations before Minecraft traffic. Updated
 * servers and proxies use peer declarations for custom payloads that have no local rule. This lets
 * a modded client describe its requirements to a proxy whose backend does not run Raknetify2. Local
 * declarations take precedence, and rules never affect another connection or classify ordinary
 * vanilla packets. Older peers ignore the advertisement and retain their existing routing behavior.
